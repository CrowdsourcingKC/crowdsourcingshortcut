## About

When I decided to write a book about the future of crowdsourcing, I also decided to practice what I preach. I am making this book open-source, and I am hosting it here on GitHub so that, you, the crowd, can contribute to it.

## My Ulterior Motive

As a budding writer of developer documentation, I am now comfortable with the concept of version control and with using GitHub because those are tools that my audience uses every day. Furthermore, I understand its value as a tool for collaboration. In addition, I know how to navigate the world of open-source software and get involved with the community. I want to share this knowledge and skill with you, my fellow writers.

Feel free to make updates, change the content, or alter the presentation of the book.
