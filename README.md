# Crowdsourcing As a Shortcut to Techno-Utopia

I am hosting my E-book on GitHub to encourage others to contribute to it.

It was previously [hosted on Medium](https://medium.com/@CrowdsourcingKC/crowdsourcing-as-a-shortcut-to-the-technological-singularity-free-e-book-bb7357a53f70).


Blog post coming soon to announce the project... Stay tuned!
