# Crowdsourcing As a Shortcut to Techno-Utopia

This E-book is hosted on GitHub to encourage you to contribute to it. (Note: It was previously [hosted on Medium](https://medium.com/@CrowdsourcingKC/crowdsourcing-as-a-shortcut-to-the-technological-singularity-free-e-book-bb7357a53f70).)

## About

When I decided to write a book about the future of crowdsourcing, I also decided to practice what I preach! I am making this book open-source, and I am hosting it here on GitHub so that, you, the crowd, can contribute to it.

## My Ulterior Motives

As a budding writer of developer documentation, I am comfortable with the concept of version control and with using GitHub (as a tool for collaboration) because those are tools that my audience uses every day. (It was not easy getting here!)

With this project, I want to give other budding writers a chance to learn:

- How to navigate the world of open-source software / get involved with the community.
- How to use Git and GitHub

## What changes are you looking for?

Feel free to:
- Make updates
- Change the content
- Alter the appearance of the book (changes to the Jekyll theme or HTML tricks)

See the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/CrowdsourcingKC/crowdsourcingshortcut/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to see how you can get started. I'm excited to see what you come up with!
