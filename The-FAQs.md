### Is This Worth Reading?

If you do not currently live in a tech-fueled utopia, and if the abilities of machines do not yet match those of humans, then these words cannot be useless…

### Who Should Read this Book?

This book is for those who have already been convinced that technology is going to get really-good, really-fast in the next few years and decades. I do not make an argument, here, to prove the how or why for this; I have left that up to other researchers, writers, scientists, and futurists. (If you’re looking for a quick intro to this topic, however, I can recommend reading the Wikipedia article on “The Technological Singularity”.)

This book is for those interested in crowdsourcing, and it is for those looking for a shortcut to an exciting future.

### Why Doesn’t This Book Cite Specific Companies, People, or Real-World
Examples?

I have decided not to cite individual’s names or company names as much as possible. This book’s focus is on general trends in technology, and I do not want information associated with particular crowdsourcing and other tech-based products (especially the ones in the news at the time of your reading this) getting in the way of my main points.

I also avoid citing names as a way to keep my thoughts on track. I have worked with several crowdsourcing and tech companies, and I want to avoid projecting the biases I have formed from this.

### Is Reading This Book a Good Way to Learn the Basics of Crowdsourcing?

Unfortunately, no. I will only breeze through the basics. If you would like to learn more about crowdsourcing as a business model and as a technology, I recommend getting acquainted with something like an ‘introduction to crowdsourcing’ type of book or by looking into it more deeply online. I especially recommend exploring online-directories of crowdsourcing-powered companies.

I’ll be the first to admit, though, that reading can only do so much; crowdsourcing can be found in its best form in the shape of companies and apps. In my opinion, it takes-hands on experiences (microtasking as worker and requester, crowdfunding as donor or campaigner, and entering innovation contests or holding them) to fully understand and appreciate crowdsourcing.

### How to Read This Book

You can enjoy it front to back, or you can read each chapter in isolation.
You can also just browse the short-stories and comics in each chapter to get the basic-ideas (or to give yourself a refresher). This book is meant to be informational, not a literary masterpiece!
Each future-shortcut-chapter will be based on a short ‘if-then statement’ to summarize their argument. These statements will be in text-form in each illustration.
